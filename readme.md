# ðŸ§  AI Paper Implementations â€“ Learn AI by Rebuilding It

This repository is a personal learning project focused on **understanding artificial intelligence through implementation of research papers from scratch**.

Rather than following high-level tutorials or using prebuilt libraries, the goal is to read original scientific papers and recreate the algorithms step by step â€” using only math and code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this project is to:

- Learn the **core ideas behind AI models** by rebuilding them from first principles
- Understand the **historical development** of machine learning (from Perceptron to Transformers)
- Gain **practical coding experience** by manually implementing everything (no black boxes)
- Build a long-term **reference and knowledge base** for future work or teaching

## ðŸ§± Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a separate paper or model implementation.  
Each folder contains:

- `README.md` â€“ notes and summary of the paper  
- `model.py` â€“ core implementation  
- `data.py` or `notebook.ipynb` â€“ dataset and tests  
- Additional files for training, visualizing, or experimenting
